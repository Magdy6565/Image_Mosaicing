# Image_Mosaicing
This project implements image mosaicing using computer vision techniques. The workflow includes detecting feature points using SIFT , finding correspondences between images, estimating the homography matrix, and blending images to create seamless mosaics. The project supports mosaicing of two or three images, producing high-quality panoramic views.
